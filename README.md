# Color picker and suggester plugin for Adobe XD

## About

A simple plugin for Adobe XD that generates a specificed number of colors based on a user given gradient.

**Reason**: the plugin provides a more seamless way to use sampled colors from user created gradients in Adobe XD.

## How to use

1. On the plugin panel at the top there are two input fields to specify the endpoints of the gradient. Enter the desired hexadecimal code of a color to update a gradient endpoint.
2. Use the number field to specifiy the sampling number of the gradient. Min value is 2, max value is 30.
3. Press Generate; a number of colored boxes should appear with HEX values and two buttons to copy to clipboard or to assets.
4. Press Generate again with different colors and different number of colors to get a new list.

**NOTE**: The option to toggle HEX, RGB, HSB color code outputs is currently unavailable.
